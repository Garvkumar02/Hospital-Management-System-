# Hospital Management System

This is a simple **Hospital Management System** implemented in C. It allows users to manage patient records by adding, viewing, searching, and deleting patient information stored in a binary file.

## Features

- **Add Patient**: Add a new patient record with details such as ID, name, age, gender, and disease.
- **View All Patients**: Display all patient records stored in the system.
- **Search Patient**: Search for a patient by their unique ID.
- **Delete Patient**: Delete a patient record by their ID.
- **Exit**: Exit the program.

## How It Works

The program uses a binary file (`patients.dat`) to store patient records persistently. Each record is stored as a structure containing the following fields:

- `id`: Patient ID (integer)
- `name`: Patient name (string)
- `age`: Patient age (integer)
- `gender`: Patient gender (string)
- `disease`: Patient disease (string)

## Prerequisites

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Basic knowledge of C programming

## How to Compile and Run

1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the code using GCC:
   ```sh
   gcc HSY.c -o HospitalManagementSystem
